This document complements factual correctness evaluation by **demonstrating a structured process** for verifying AI outputs against textbooks and reference materials.

---

## 1. Evaluation Steps
1. Identify factual statements in AI responses.
2. Compare each statement to **authoritative sources**.
3. Categorize as:
   - ✅ Correct  
   - ⚠ Minor Error  
   - ❌ Major Error
4. Document discrepancies and suggest corrections.

## 2. Example Case

**Prompt:** "Explain the causes of World War I."  
**AI Response:** "World War I started due to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and alliances between countries."  
**Evaluation:**  
- Correct main cause → ✅  
- Missing additional factors (imperialism, nationalism, militarism) → ⚠ Minor Error

## 3. Notes
- Focuses on **text accuracy**, not style or tone.  
- Only uses **publicly available textbooks and references**.  
- Aligns with educational content QA and AI factual verification roles.
