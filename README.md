AI prompt, image, safety, and factual correctness evaluation framework
# AI Prompt, Image, and Safety Evaluation Framework

This repository demonstrates a simulated framework for evaluating AI-generated
text and image responses for quality, factual accuracy, and safety using
publicly available models and datasets.

The goal is to showcase best practices in AI quality assurance, prompt grading,
multimodal evaluation, and factual verification without using proprietary data
or systems.

## Evaluation Areas
- Prompt clarity and response relevance
- Image person insertion accuracy and realism
- Safety and harmful content avoidance
- Factual correctness when referencing educational materials
- Policy-aligned AI behavior

## Tools & Data
- Publicly available language and image models
- Open datasets and synthetic prompts
- Self-designed evaluation rubrics

This project reflects transferable AI evaluation skills commonly used across
industry applications.
