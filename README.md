# AI Prompt and Image Evaluation Framework

This repository demonstrates a structured framework for evaluating AI-generated outputs,
including text and images. It highlights expertise in **prompt grading, multimodal QA,
safety, ethics, and factual correctness**, all using **simulated or public AI outputs**.

---

## Key Features

- **Prompt Quality Evaluation**  
  Assess AI-generated responses for clarity, instruction adherence, coherence, and usefulness.

- **Image Person Insertion Checks**  
  Evaluate AI-generated images for realism, proportions, safety, and alignment with the prompt.

- **Safety and Policy Checks**  
  Identify and flag outputs containing unsafe, illegal, or unethical content.

- **Factual Correctness Verification**  
  Cross-check AI-generated responses against trusted textbooks and public references.

- **Refusal Quality Assessment**  
  Evaluate AI refusals for appropriateness, tone, completeness, and ethical reasoning.

- **Failure Mode Library**  
  Document common AI failure patterns, hallucinations, bias, and multimodal errors.

- **Ethics and Limitations**  
  Discuss ethical considerations, limitations, and edge-case handling in AI evaluation.
